To try and coordinate a date as such has the potential to constitute "manipulation", even more so after watching yesterdays hearing.

Watch the lvl2 data and even at a cursory glance you see shares of 100+ with no change on price, even to the cent. To try and coordinate a date as such has the potential to constitute "manipulation", even more so after watching yesterdays hearing. At this point we're buying at a price because we think it is a solid investment as we believe the company will grow and the price will increase.`,

Watch the lvl2 data and even at a cursory glance you see shares of 100+ with no change on price, even to the cent. To try and coordinate a date as such has the potential to constitute "manipulation", even more so after watching yesterdays hearing. At this point we're buying at a price because we think it is a solid investment as we believe the company will grow and the price will increase.`,
