Watch the lvl2 data and even at a cursory glance you see shares of 100+ with no change on price, even to the cent. To try and coordinate a date as such has the potential to constitute "manipulation", even more so after watching yesterdays hearing. At this point we're buying at a price because we think it is a solid investment as we believe the company will grow and the price will increase.`,

Watch the lvl2 data and even at a cursory glance you see shares of 100+ with no change on price, even to the cent. To try and coordinate a date as such has the potential to constitute "manipulation", even more so after watching yesterdays hearing. At this point we're buying at a price because we think it is a solid investment as we believe the company will grow and the price will increase.`,

I drowned myself in DD, read a lot of wrinkled brain posts and heard the news of GME selling those 3.5 mill shares that kept the price suppressed for 3 weeks. Needless to say, now I am jacked. Possibly even to the tits. Ive watched the big short 4 times this week. I see the low volume. I see the millions of other apes like me hodling their shares like the gold bars they are. I now dont care when moass happens because I know IT IS HAPPENING and i can wait as long as it takes to quit my job and fuk the hedgies! Patience all!',

To try and coordinate a date as such has the potential to constitute "manipulation", even more so after watching yesterdays hearing.
